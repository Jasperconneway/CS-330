Creating a 3D scene has helped me develop skills working with OpenGL and GLFW. It has given me the opportunity to create a camera that can move based on keyboard or 
mouse/scroll input, among other things. Given this was all very new to me, I had to approach this by researching and reading the materials provided to the class and 
asking additional questions. Once I had a better understanding of the material, I started by creating the object, adding texture, then material, and lighting. These 
tactics will be helpful in future work as most often as a programmer we are researching the code we need to create.

In terms of the programs, I spent time revising each header and code files to change the 3D scene. Iteration did not factor into my code but through each milestone 
my scene developed further by adding to it every week. The week of the project, I had to add much more than I did in prior weeks. I had to utilize the methods from 
before by adding each object individually and ensuring every object had a texture and material. With the lighting if an object did not have a texture, it would 
appear white. 

This class has helped me broaden my education to include designing a scene using code. This opens up my educational pathway to include game designing if I ever wish 
to work in that industry one day. I think the educational and professional pathway go hand and hand here. Ultimately, my biggest goal in life is to be a programmer, 
if I worked for a game company doing just this, I would love it the same as creating code for the security of another.
